A single entry-point **support website + smart bot** that helps customers raise issues for all your products, and gives engineers a 360° view of the customer before they even join the chat.

Built for the **Cliqtrix** hackathon using:

- **Frontend:** Static HTML, CSS, JavaScript (no framework)
- **Backend logic:** Zoho **SalesIQ Zobot** (Deluge message + context handlers)
- **Optional integrations:** Zoho Desk / Zoho CRM / Zoho Subscriptions via Deluge Connections

##  What this project does

<img width="498" height="738" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11d338be-2969-44d3-8eca-e9cd78b4a990" />


**Platform 360°** is a mini “support hub” where:

- Users land on a clean **Home / Products / Contact** website
- A **floating chat bot** in the bottom-right (SalesIQ Zobot) starts the support flow
- The bot:
  - Asks if the user is a **new** or **existing** customer
  - Gathers key details (name, email, product, issue summary, urgency…)
  - Optionally calls Zoho APIs to fetch:
    - Recent **Desk tickets**
    - **Subscription / plan** details
  - Scores the request (Hot / Warm / Cold) and forwards it to the right queue

The site branding and product names (Inbox360, BillPro, SupportDesk, etc.) are **demo product names for the hackathon**.

### 3. Optional Integrations (via Deluge `invokeurl`)

> These are optional, but show the “360°” idea:

- **Zoho Desk** – Fetch last 3 tickets:
  - `GET https://desk.zoho.com/api/v1/tickets?...&email=<cust_email>`
- **Zoho Subscriptions** – Fetch customer and plan info:
  - `GET https://subscriptions.zoho.com/api/v1/customers?email=<cust_email>&organization_id=<ORG_ID>`

Connections (example names):

- `zohodesk_subs_conn`
- `zohosubs_conn`

##  Tech Stack

**Frontend**

- `index.html` – full landing page (Home / Products / Contact)
- Inline CSS and JavaScript in the same file for simplicity

**Backend (Zoho side)**

- **Zoho SalesIQ**
  - Zobot running in **Deluge** mode
  - `Message handler` – entry and initial branching
  - `Context handler` – question flows and API calls
- **Zoho Connections**
  - Pre-configured connections to Desk / Subscriptions (if used)

No external server (Node, Django, etc.) is required.  
All “backend” logic sits inside **Zoho’s Deluge environment**.
